> A good discussion of issues related to melody generation with Cantonese lyrics. Some of the issues are not clearly presented however (especially the discussion of tone digits) and it's unclear if the software has been used to create musical works. Would also benefit from code samples, if possible, of the mapping techniques. Nevertheless, the analysis and mapping techniques presented will be of interest to conference delegates.

A better way to compose striking songs is to understand the language of music, statistics are not the way to get there. I would be interesting to research to what extent statistics match human appreciation.

> This problem cannot be solved. The reviewer simply do not agree with the possibility that computer can generate good music. However, I think we may mention in the introduction that “T-Music” is not created to replace human composer. But created as a aid or tool-kit to facilitate the composition procedure.
