\section{Conclusion And Future Directions}\label{sec:conclusion}
We have introduced a novel algorithmic composer called T-Music, which uses the correlations between melodies and lyrics to compose melody for the input lyrics.

	Two new methods has been proposed to mine fps from plain music.
	An optimal method of composing a melody for input lyrics in one language based on the fps in another language has been presented.

	There are plenty of possibilities to further improve T-Music. For example, we may also consider to use the correlations between melodies and the syllables of lyrics to compose melody.
	Besides, the number of notes in the generated melody is same as the number of tones in lyrics. If T-Music can generate a longer melody by introducing some notes that does not associate with any tones, there will be more variety of the melody.

	This paper is a condensed form of a Master thesis~\cite{Y16}.
