\begin{CJK*}{UTF8}{zhsong}
Spoken Language is known as speech. Speech is a sequence of sounds that conveys a meaning.
A \textit{syllable} is a basic unit in a speech.
For example, in English, the phonetic of the word ``music'' contains two syllables.\footnote{Chinese phonetic is also called pinyin.} They are \textipa{[mju:]} and \textipa{[zIk]}.
In Mandarin, the phonetic of the word ``音'' contains 1 syllable. It is [y\={\i}n].
\end{CJK*}
There is a mark on top of the i in [y\={\i}n]. It is a tone symbol. It tells us how to pronounce this syllable with correct tone.

The languages can be classified as \textit{tonal} or \textit{non-tonal languages}. For both kinds of language, there are tone variations. Even in non-tonal languages, people do not speak in monotone!
However, if someone speaks a sentence in monotone in English, others can still understand. The meaning of the sentence will not be ambiguous.
In tonal languages, the tone of a word is important for distinguishing the word from another.
	
\subsection{Tonal Languages}

In English, a word ``men'' with phonetic \textipa{[men]} is different to another word ``man'' with phonetic \textipa{[m{\ae}n]} because they have different vowels \textipa{[e]} and \textipa{[\ae]}. Using different tones to pronounce them will not change their meanings.

In Cantonese, which is a tonal language, a word conveys different meanings if it is pronounced in different tones. Cantonese has six tones~\cite{CT11}.
Figure \ref{fig:cantoneseToneContours} shows the six tones and meanings of a word [si] if it is pronounced in these six tones. It is modified from \cite{FCM+08}.
	We can also represent a tone contour by a tone digit. For example, the 1\textsuperscript{st} tone in Cantonese starts and ends at almost the highest pitch. By setting the highest pitch as 5 and the lowest pitch as 1. The tone digit of the 1\textsuperscript{st} tone is 55. The tone digits of the remaining five tones are 25, 33, 21, 23 and 22~\cite{Flynn01}.
	It is shown in Figure \ref{fig:cantoneseMandarinTones}.
\begin{CJK*}{UTF8}{zhsong}		

	Mandarin has four formal tones. They are 55, 35, 214 and 51~\cite{LZ03}.  There is a special tone called \textit{neutral tone} in Mandarin.\footnote{In Chinese, it is called ``qīng shēng (輕聲)'', which literally means ``light tone''.}
	When a syllable is associated with it, the syllable is pronounced shorter and unstressed. It is not considerered as a formal tone because the pitch value of it is determined by the tone of the preceding syllable~\cite{Wang04}. The five tones (including the natural tone) are shown in Figure \ref{fig:cantoneseMandarinTones}.
\end{CJK*}

\subsection{Non-Tonal Languages}
	In English, which is a non-tonal language, has three kinds of stress, namely the primary stress, the secondary stress and the non-stress. Consider a word ``education'', which have four syllables \textipa{[e-j@-kA-sh@n]}, we will stress on the \textipa{[kA]}, stress lightly on \textipa{[e]} and non-stress on \textipa{[j@]} and \textipa{[sh@n]}. These three stresses can be treated as three tones.
	
	In Japanese, which is also a non-tonal language, has two kinds of stress. They can be treated as two tones.

\subsection{Summary}
	Given a word, we can obtain its (syllable, tone) sequence by reading dictionary. We are only interested in the tone part but not the syllable part.
	For the input lyrics, we can obtain a sequence of consisted words by applying word segmentation.\footnote{Word segmentation is a trivial task for English because the words in a English sentence are separated by a space. For other languages, it can be a difficult task. For example, Thai, as there is no inter-word spacing.}
	We can compute a tone sequence for the input lyrics.
