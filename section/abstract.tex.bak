Music is a temporal art, which unfolds over time. Unlike painting, which is a spatial art, can be seen entirely immediately. Music can tell more things than other arts do.

Song is a kind of music that contains lyrics. Song can express more things than a plain music does. 
People want to have their own songs for their special days.
However, composing a song is hard because of the presence of lyrics.

There is an algorithmic melody composer called ``T-Music'', which mines the correlations between the melodies and the lyrics and uses these correlations to compose a melody for the input lyrics. These correlations are represented in \textbf{f}requent \textbf{p}atterns (\textbf{fp}s).

This paper presents the ways to enhance T-Music.
The original T-Music can only mine fps from songs. We propose two new methods to mine fps from plain music.
We also introduce an optimal way to use fps mined from songs in one language to compose a melody for the input lyrics in another language.
