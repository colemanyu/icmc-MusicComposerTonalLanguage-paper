  abstract      = {There are a bulk of studies on proposing algorithms for composing the melody of a song automatically with algorithms, which is known as algorithmic composition. To the best of our knowledge, none of them took the lyric into consideration for melody composition. However, according to some recent studies, within a song, there usually exists a certain extent of correlation between its melody and its lyric. In this demonstration, we propose to utilize this type of correlation information for melody composition. Based on this idea, we design a new melody composition algorithm and develop a melody composer called T-Music which employs this composition algorithm.},

  abstract      = {Algorithmic composition refers to the process of composing a melody automatically using algorithms. A bulk of methods have been proposed for this task. Among them, a novel idea is to utilize the correlation information between the pitches of melodies and the tones of lyrics for melody composition. Unfortunately, the existing method adopting this idea suffers from several severe shortcomings and thus the merits of the above idea are not fully utilized. In this paper, we propose a new technique to capture the above correlation information based on the concepts of pitch trends and tone trends. Based on this technique, we design a new algorithm called Trend-{MC} for melody composition which avoids the shortcomings of the existing method. We also developed a software with the Trend-{MC} algorithm as its core. We demonstrate that the software could compose nice melodies with the input of lyrics.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents the Computoser hybrid probability/rule based algorithm for music composition (http://computoser.com) and provides a reference implementation. It addresses the issues of unpleasantness and lack of variation exhibited by many existing approaches by combining the two methods (basing the parameters of the rules on data obtained from preliminary analysis). A sample of 500+ musical pieces was analyzed to derive probabilities for musical characteristics and events (e.g. scale, tempo, intervals). The algorithm was constructed to produce musical pieces using the derived probabilities combined with a large set of composition rules, which were obtained and structured after studying established composition practices. Generated pieces were published on the Computoser website where evaluation was performed by listeners. The feedback was positive (58.4\% approval), asserting the merits of the undertaken approach. The paper compares this hybrid approach to other approaches to algorithmic composition and presents a survey of the pleasantness of the resulting music.},
